MAILBOOT
========

INTRODUCTION
============

Once upon a time, a computer reboot. Again. And again. And again.

Whereas a lot of computers reboot and we don't care, few should not reboot
without notifying someone.

**MAILBOOT** is a small program (and systemd service unit) used to send an email
when a computer boot (or reboot), providing useful informations and setupable
in less than 1min.

Why do not use cron?
--------------------
I started with a cron line. But after workarounded the basic missing feature of
customizing the mail subject in my cron daemon (fcron) in using mail command,
I was borred by being able to send interesting information in one sh line.
So I decided to find another solution. Here we are.


What you cannot do with mailboot?
-----------------------------------
The coffee.


HOW TO USE IT
=============
To print the mail::

  $ mailboot -p

To send the mail::

  $ mailboot -s

To send the mail at reboot::

.. caution::
**A working mail forwarder is expected on your system.
The sendmail command must be functionnal!**
